			<h4>1.Introduction</h4>
			<p>
This page includes the overall report of web development’s assignment. In this assessment we were assigned to develop a “CV” website of us with the knowledge of HTML and CSS, which we received from our web development class. There are many parts in this assignment. We were asked to develop six webpages named index.html, cv.html, social.html, about.html, contact.html and model.html with their responsive contents. I also made my website media responsive since 60% of users are mobile users. We must complete certain task in each page to complete our assignment. We must upload it in GitHub and provide live URL to the module leader. I took some time on deciding the appearance of my website. After doing lots of practice and wireframes I decided to make this template as my CV. I looked at some of the similar website to gain some idea to make my website more attractive. I tried to implement my all skills in this website. Talking about group work, we also worked as a group to help each other out on simple things like designing the website and giving feedbacks where we learned more about CSS and HTML. We discussed about current trending designs. My website has approach to Google Material Design. I have used modern user interface designs and navigation system. My experience on first team of web development was quite good. I got to learn many new things and got chance to demonstrate my skills through this assessment. From the first week I have interest and enthusiasm in web development. As time passed I have gained more knowledge and I keep improving myself in web development.

			<h4>2. Background</h4>
		<p>As I have developed six pages, there were some tasks in each page to be completed. The first page is my landing page, which will open in sequence as according to our setting in GitHub. It will be named as index.html. Second one is my About page where I must write my short biography and my professional aspirations as a developer. It will be name as about.html. Third one is our curriculum vitae i.e. CV named as cv.html. In this my task was to use at least 2 columns using flexbox. I can see existing templets for ideas. After this we have social page named as social.html. Here I must provide my social media links like Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn, twitter etc. After this we have contact page named as contact.html. Here I must include static form and a map of our location on earth using google maps. Finally, we have our report in html format</p>

	<h4>5. Conclusion</h4>
			<p>With all the hard work I finally designed a webpage and made it responsive as well. I had some problems regarding user interface design and responsive, but I solved those problems and received my current result. Over all it was a new and good experience for me, I learned things which will be very helpful for me. At the beginning I felt a bit difficult while making website, but working in a group helped me. Not only I have learnt how to create website, I also learnt how to improve yourself and how important team work is.</p>
